This C# program demonstrates the usage of various data types:

1. **Integer Types**: 
   - `int`, `long`, `short`, `byte`, and `sbyte` are declared and initialized with integer values of different sizes.

2. **Floating-Point Types**:
   - `float` and `double` are declared and initialized with floating-point values of different precision.

3. **Decimal Type**:
   - `decimal` is declared and initialized with a decimal value.

4. **Character Type**:
   - `char` is declared and initialized with a character value.

5. **Boolean Type**:
   - `bool` is declared and initialized with boolean values (`true` and `false`).

6. **String Type**:
   - `string` is declared and initialized with a string value.

Within the `Main` method:
- Each variable is printed with a corresponding label using `Console.WriteLine`.
- The program prints the values of each variable to the console.

This program serves as a basic demonstration of how to declare, initialize, and use different data types in C#. It covers various fundamental data types used for storing different kinds of values in C# programs.
